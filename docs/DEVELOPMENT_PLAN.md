## Tools & Technologies by Phase

| Phase | Primary Tech | Supporting Tech |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1 | TypeScript, Docker | ESLint, Prettier, Jest |

| 3 | Redis, Express | - |
| 4 | PostgreSQL, Express | - |
| 5 | RabbitMQ, Express | - |
| 6 | Elasticsearch, Express | - |
| 7 | WebSocket, Express | Image processing |
| 8 | Kubernetes, Docker | Prometheus, Grafana |

## Success Metrics

- **Phase 1**: Development environment working
- **Phase 2**: User registration/login functional
- **Phase 3**: User profiles with caching
- **Phase 4**: Posts with interactions
- **Phase 5**: Services communicating via events
- **Phase 6**: Search functionality working
- **Phase 7**: Real-time features operational
- **Phase 8**: Production deployment successful

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Complexity Management**: Start simple, add complexity gradually
2. **Technology Learning**: Allocate extra time for new technologies
3. **Integration Issues**: Test integrations early and often
4. **Performance**: Monitor and optimize at each phase
5. **Security**: Implement security from the beginning

This plan provides a structured approach while maintaining flexibility for adjustments based on learning and requirements changes.
