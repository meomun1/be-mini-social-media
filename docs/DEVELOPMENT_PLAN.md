# Development Plan - Mini Facebook Backend

## Overview
This document outlines a phased approach to building the mini Facebook backend using microservices architecture. Each phase builds upon the previous one, allowing for incremental development and testing.

### Shared Infrastructure Approach
The project uses a shared infrastructure layer for common technologies (Redis, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ, WebSocket, Database utilities) while maintaining service-specific databases. This approach provides:
- **Consistency**: Standardized connection management and key naming conventions
- **Efficiency**: Shared connections reduce resource usage
- **Maintainability**: Centralized configuration and updates
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new services using the same infrastructure
- **Database Management**: Shared utilities for migrations, seeders, and base repository patterns

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1-2)
**Goal**: Establish project structure and basic infrastructure

- **Phase 6**: Search functionality working
- **Phase 7**: Real-time features operational
- **Phase 8**: Production deployment successful

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Complexity Management**: Start simple, add complexity gradually
2. **Technology Learning**: Allocate extra time for new technologies
3. **Integration Issues**: Test integrations early and often
4. **Performance**: Monitor and optimize at each phase
